&lt;p&gt;In my previous posts you can see more about blockchain, i thought of introducing you to understand how blockchain works and move towards blockchain frameworks like hyperledger and Ethereum Dapps. If you have read my previous articles &lt;strong&gt;Understand Blockchain - Beginner to Advanced -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.sriramj.xyz/understand-blockchain-beginner-to-advanced&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.sriramj.xyz/understand-blockchain-beginner-to-advanced-part-2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;you would have got some theoretical overview of how blockchain works. Lets get more deeper and understand blockchain at a very ground level. Be it public or private blockchain everyone needs the data to be safe and secure, cryptography is the art of securing information. This article will provide details why and where cryptography is being used and some historical cryptographic techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objectives:-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn how crypto primitives work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn how to use them correctly and reason about security&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is Cryptography ?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;History of Cryptography ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cryptography is everywhere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptography is everywhere computers are, its a very common tool to protect data.
For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Web traffic is protected using protocol HTTPS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wireless traffic is protected using WPA2(802.11i), GSM, Bluetooth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Files on disk are encrypted using protocols EFS, TrueCrypt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Content protecting in DVD’s and Bluray using protocols Content Scrambling System (CSS) and AACS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User Authentication and lot more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_B9864D4913735962AC3DE2BAA0D3BFE8B8192C1A5FD3A5D869FB844E4A174363_1524926580595_ssl-connection-t.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lets see how cryptography is used to secure communication. Refer above image, we have a server and a laptop which is the client. A lot of the internet has recently been switching to something called HTTPS protocol. This allows for all communications between the client and server to be encrypted through the use of public key encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protocol that is used to build this secure channel is HTTPS but the actual protocol is  SSL/TLS. The goals of this protocol is basically to make sure that data travels across the network an attacker cannot eavesdrop on this data. Secondly, the attacker cannot modify the data while it’s in the network. So, no eavesdropping, no tampering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The non-secure HTTP (hyper-text transfer protocol) generally transmits all of it’s data in plaintext (though there are exceptions, such as when JavaScript is involved). This means that anyone that could intercept the message (such as on the same WiFi network) could plainly read the data being sent between the client’s machine and the server. This can include passwords, credit card data, and other sensitive information. For this reason, https was created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secure Socket Layer (SSL)/ TLS actually consists of two main parts :-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_B9864D4913735962AC3DE2BAA0D3BFE8B8192C1A5FD3A5D869FB844E4A174363_1524929007150_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(i) Handshake protocol to establish shared secret key using public-key cryptography.See the above image, basically at the end of the handshake a shared secret key appears between two of the them. Both alice and bob knows the secret key but the attacker looking at the conversation has no idea what the key is. We can use this key to communicate securely by properly encrypting the data between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(ii) Record layer to transmit data using shared secret key&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;will cover more about them in later articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protection of files on disk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_B9864D4913735962AC3DE2BAA0D3BFE8B8192C1A5FD3A5D869FB844E4A174363_1524975749847_file-protection-final.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another application of cryptography is to protect files on disk. See above image, here we have file that happens to be encrypted. So, even if the disk is stolen an attacker can’t actually read the contents of the file. If an attacker tries to modify the data on disk, when alice tries to decrypt this file that will be detected and obviously alice will then ignore the content of tampered file. Here we have both integrity and confidentiality for files stored on disk. This is analogous to secure communication which we saw earlier. In particular, storing files on disk its alice who encrypts and decrypts the file. While on secure communication we had alice and bob involved in encryption &amp;amp; decryption processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The building block for securing traffic is called symmetric encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symmetric Encryption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symmetric-key algorithms are algorithms for cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys for both encryption of plaintext and decryption of ciphertext. The keys may be identical or there may be a simple transformation to go between the two keys. The keys, in practice, represent a shared secret between two or more parties that can be used to maintain a private information link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_B9864D4913735962AC3DE2BAA0D3BFE8B8192C1A5FD3A5D869FB844E4A174363_1524980898476_symmetric-encryption.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symmetric encryption system basically two parties alice &amp;amp; bob share secret key (k) which attacker doesn’t know. Only then know the secret key k, Now, they’re gonna use a cipher which consists of these two algorithms  E (encryption) and D (decryption). Encryption algorithm takes message &amp;amp; key as input and produces a corresponding ciphertext. And the decryption algorithm does the opposite, it takes ciphertext &amp;amp; key as input and produces the corresponding message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, a very important point that I would like to stress. I’m only gonna say this once now and never again, but it is an extremely important point. And that is: that the algorithms E and D, the actual encryption algorithms are publicly known. Adversary knows exactly how they work. The only thing that’s kept secret is the secret key k. Other than that everything else is completely public and it’s really important to realize that you should only use algorithms that are public because those algorithms have been peer-reviewed by a very large community of hundreds of people for many, many, many years, and these algorithms only begin to be used once this community has shown that they cannot be broken, essentially. So in fact, if somebody comes to you and says, hey, I have a proprietary cipher that you might want to use, the answer usually should be that you stick to standards, to standard algorithms, and not use a proprietary cipher. In fact, there are many examples of proprietary ciphers that, as soon as they were reverse engineered, they were easily broken by simple analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things to remember&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptography is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the basis for many security mechanisms&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a tremendous tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptography is not&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the solution to all security problems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reliable unless implemented and used properly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;something you should try to invent yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we start with the technical material, I wanna give you a quick overview of what cryptography is about and the different areas of cryptography. So the core of cryptography of course is secure communication that essentially consists of two parts. The first is secured key establishment and then how do we communicate securely once we have a shared key. We already said that secured key establishment essentially amounts to Alice and Bob sending messages to one another such that at the end of this protocol, there’s a shared key that they both agree on, shared key K, and beyond that, beyond just a shared key, in fact Alice would know that she’s talking to Bob and Bob would know that he’s talking to Alice. But a poor attacker who listens in on this conversation has no idea what the shared key is. Now once they have a shared key, they want to exchange messages securely using this key, and we’ll talk about encryption schemes that allow them to do that in such a way that an attacker can’t figure out what messages are being sent back and forth. And furthermore an attacker cannot even tamper with this traffic without being detected. In other words, these encryption schemes provide both confidentiality and integrity. But cryptography does much, much, much more than just these two things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crypto can do much more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital Signatures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First example i want to give is called a digital signature. So, a digital signature is basically analog of signature in physical world.In the physical world, remember when you sign a document, essentially, you write your signature on that document and your signature is always the same. You always write the same signature on all documents that you wanna sign. In the digital world, this can’t possibly work because if the attacker just obtained one signed document from me, he can cut and paste my signature into some other document that I might not have wanted to sign. And so, it’s simply not possible in a digital world that my signature is the same for all documents that I want to sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_B9864D4913735962AC3DE2BAA0D3BFE8B8192C1A5FD3A5D869FB844E4A174363_1524991947764_digital-signature.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re gonna talk about how to construct digital signatures in later articles. It’s really quite an interesting primitive and we’ll see exactly how to do it. Just to give you a hint, the way digital signatures work is basically by making the digital signature via function of the content being signed. So an attacker who tries to copy my signature from one document to another is not gonna succeed because the signature on the new document is not gonna be the proper function of the data in the new document, and as a result, the signature won’t verify. And as I said, we’re gonna see exactly how to construct digital signatures later on and then we’ll prove that those constructions are secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anonymous Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_B9864D4913735962AC3DE2BAA0D3BFE8B8192C1A5FD3A5D869FB844E4A174363_1524992424825_anonymous_communication.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another application of cryptography that I wanted to mention, is anonymous communication. So, here, imagine user Alice wants to talk to some chat server, Bob. And, perhaps she wants to talk about a medical condition, and so she wants to do that anonymously, so that the chat server doesn’t actually know who she is. Well, there’s a standard method, called a mixnet, that allows Alice to communicate over the public internet with Bob through a sequence of proxies such that at the end of the communication Bob has no idea who he just talked to. The way mixnets work is basically as Alice sends her messages to Bob through a sequence of proxies, these messages get encrypted and decrypted appropriately so that Bob has no idea who he talked to and the proxies themselves don’t even know that Alice is talking to Bob, or that actually who is talking to whom more generally. One interesting thing about this anonymous communication channel is, this is bi-directional. In other words, even though Bob has no idea who he’s talking to, he can still respond to Alice and Alice will get those messages. Once we have anonymous communication, we can build other privacy mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anonymous Digital Cash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I wanna give you one more example which is called anonymous digital cash. Remember that in the physical world if I have a physical dollar, I can walk into a bookstore and buy a book and the merchant would have no idea who I am. The question is whether we can do the exact same thing in the digital world. In the digital world, basically, Alice might have a digital dollar, a digital dollar coin. And she might wanna spend that digital dollar at some online merchants, perhaps some online bookstore. Now, what we’d like to do is make it so that when Alice spends her coin at the bookstore, the bookstore would have no idea who Alice is. So we provide the same anonymity that we get from physical cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_B9864D4913735962AC3DE2BAA0D3BFE8B8192C1A5FD3A5D869FB844E4A174363_1524994227866_anonymous_digital_cash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the problem is that in the digital world, Alice can take the coin that she had, this one dollar coin, and before she spent it, she can actually make copies of it. And then all of a sudden instead of just having just one dollar coin now all of a sudden she has three dollar coins and they’re all the same of course, and there’s nothing preventing her from taking those replicas of a dollar coin and spending it at other merchants. And so the question is how do we provide anonymous digital cash? But at the same time, also prevent Alice from double spending the dollar coin at different merchants. In some sense there’s a paradox here where anonymity is in conflict with security because if we have anonymous cash there’s nothing to prevent Alice from double spending the coin and because the coin is anonymous we have no way of telling who committed this fraud. And so the question is how do we resolve this tension. And it turns out, it’s completely doable. And we’ll talk about anonymous digital cash later on. Just to give you a hint, I’ll say that the way we do it is basically by making sure that if Alice spends the coin once then no one knows who she is, but if she spends the coin more than once, all of a sudden, her identity is completely exposed and then she could be subject to all sorts of legal problems. And so that’s how anonymous digital cash would work at a high level and we’ll see how to implement it in later articles.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sriram Jothiswaran</name></author><category term="cryptography" /><summary type="html">Cryptography zero to hero - part 1| Introduction and history of Cryptography</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">5 questions you should ask yourself before choosing Blockchain Technology</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/5-questions-why-you-should-blockchain-technology" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="5 questions you should ask yourself before choosing Blockchain Technology" /><published>2018-04-06T23:27:24+05:30</published><updated>2018-04-06T23:27:24+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/5-questions-why-you-should-blockchain-technology</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/5-questions-why-you-should-blockchain-technology">&lt;p&gt;As the market around blockchain continues to grow, a range of different distributed ledger technologies are becoming available for enterprise users to apply blockchain. When looking at your options, it is important to note that certain protocols are suited to certain use cases, and time-to-value can be accelerated by leveraging existing networks that already exist. In this blog, I will give you a series of questions to consider when selecting a distributed ledger technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the protocol open sourced and openly governed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply posting code on an open developer site is not enough — there needs to be a governing body which maintains the code in line with enterprise needs.Hyperledger openly validates the inputs through the Technical Steering Committee to ensure innovations are supported which harden blockchain for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent addition of zero-knowledge proofs and identity mixer to Hyperledger Fabric demonstrates Hyperledger’s willingness to support continuous innovation for enterprise needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other protocols such as Ethereum and Corda lie at the hands of a very small group of developers, often from a single organization. This means they centrally control the roadmap of their technologies, ultimately at the expense of innovation in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who will be a part of the network?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next key question for an organization is; who are the intended participants of the blockchain network? Participants can include business partners, application providers, regulators or even competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of enterprise networks require that at least a core subset of the network members, if not all, need to be known to each other. We call this a permission network. Hyperledger Fabric allows a common identity verification scheme to be configured for a network. This scheme can be configured for a small private network, or for a more distributed public facing network. The key consideration is whether sufficient data will be known so that you can interact with a sufficient trust in who is on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many other enterprise protocols rely on single organizations to act as gates to approve participants as well as transactions. This model struggles to scale as the network grows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What use case will drive transactions on the network?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key consideration when choosing a protocol is the types of transactions that will be submitted to the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the transactions are for an arbitrary asset type — as in defined for the network and representing a physical or digital asset — a programming model like Hyperledger Composer can be used to model the assets, participants and transactions. This can then be deployed to a running instance of Hyperledger Fabric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also when you should consider the privacy and security implications of your transactions. In many cases you may need a protocol that will allow you to keep transaction data private between participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use case may also necessitate the use of a trusted public network when dictated by a business need. Two prime examples of this are for trusted identity and universal payments. For instance, a distributed ledger like Stellar enables transfer of cross-border payments, enabling universal settlement of assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the technology modular and easy to use?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the most critical aspects of a distributed ledger technology for enterprise use is the ability to configure the technology for an enterprise use-case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key features such as consensus, permissions and database, should be modular to the needs of a specific use case. For instance, one use-case may require every participant in the network to endorse transactions before they are considered valid, while others may have less stringent requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many distributed ledger technologies struggle to support needed levels of modularity and therefore have to rely on bulky consensus protocols like proof of work in order to scale. Even worse, making changes to these aspects of the network even when used for a private network may require complex development processes to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corda, for instance, is only configurable for private networks in the financial space, rather than being a modular technology which can be used for a range of use cases across industries, integrating multiple additional technologies for IoT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does blockchain meet the other key enterprise requirements?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability&lt;/strong&gt; – Distributed ledger technologies must be able to scale as the network grows in terms of both transactions and participants. Things such as centralized validation services and complex peer compiling processes have a high likelihood of limiting scale.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;**Regulatory risk ** – One of the biggest open questions in the blockchain space is the regulatory perspective on cryptocurrencies as an application of distributed ledger technology. Due consideration should be given to the likelihood of regulatory action on protocols supporting public cryptocurrencies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills availability&lt;/strong&gt; – The blockchain space has seen a number of high profile data and asset breaches due to the immaturity of new programming languages. Enterprise users should leverage distributed ledger technologies which enable their developers to work with tools and programming languages they are already familiar with.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;**Support ** – Like any enterprise application, there needs to be an appropriate level of support for the entire stack. Whether through open source communities or platform and solution providers, support is needed from the build to production phases of adoption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 61-bank consortium, led by SBI Ripple Asia, is representative of more than 80 percent of all of Japan’s banking assets, according to Ripple. Takashi Okita, CEO of SBI Ripple Asia, said in Ripple’s blog post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“Together with the trust, reliability and reach of the bank consortium, we can remove friction from payments and create a faster, safer, and more efficient domestic payments experience for our customers.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three of the banks in the consortium, SBI Net Sumishin Bank, Suruga Bank and Resona Bank, will begin using the app this coming fall, while the rest of the banks will join in gradually. MoneyTap will allow users to make purchases 24 hours a day, every day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ripple has long focused on building relationships with banks to use its payment technologies. In February, Ripple announced two new financial service partnerships; one with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority for use of its cross-border payment technology for banks within the country and another with Western Union, who is testing Ripple’s Blockchain-based settlement system for transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month, a South Korean bank also announced that it planned on using Ripple’s cross-border payment technologies for remittances, prompted by a Japanese-based test of Blockchain-based remittances involving Ripple and SBI Group.&lt;/p&gt;

As it picks up momentum, will the traditional banking industry embrace this new technology or be replaced by it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last September, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon took a stab at Bitcoin: “It’s worse than tulip bulbs. It won’t end well. Someone is going to get killed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lloyd Blankfein, head of Goldman Sachs echoed that thought, saying, “Something that moves 20% [overnight] does not feel like a currency. It is a vehicle to perpetrate fraud.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet at the same time, according to a survey by The International Securities Association, 55% of companies polled are monitoring, researching, or developing solutions on top of blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this very loud and public backlash against cryptocurrencies from banks begs the question: What do banks have to be afraid of?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short answer is “a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain technology provides a cryptographically secure way of sending digital assets, without the need for trusted third parties — such as banks. Further, tools such as smart contracts promise to automate many of the tedious processes within the banking industry, from compliance and claims processing, to distributing the contents of a will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global banking is currently a $134 trillion industry. Banks help intermediate payments, make loans, and provide credit. The promise of blockchain as a trustless, disintermediated technology is to disrupt all of that, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Payments: By eliminating the need to rely on intermediaries to approve transactions between consumers, blockchain technology could facilitate faster payments at lower fees than banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearance and Settlement Systems: Blockchain technology and distributed ledgers can reduce operational costs and bring us closer to real-time transactions between financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundraising: By providing blockchain companies with immediate access to liquidity through initial coin offerings (ICOs), the blockchain is creating a new, cryptoeconomic model of funding that unbundles access to capital from traditional financial services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Securities: By tokenizing traditional securities such as stocks, bonds, and alternative assets, the blockchain is upending the structure of capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loans and Credit: By removing the need for gatekeepers in the loan and credit industry, the blockchain can make it more secure to borrow money and provide lower interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read on for a deep dive into how the blockchain could turn the traditional banking industry on its head while enabling new business models through technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-payments&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Payments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, trillions of dollars slosh around the world via an antiquated system of slow payments and added fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you work in San Francisco and want to send part of your paycheck back to your family in London, you might have to pay a $25 flat fee for the wire, and additional fees adding up to 7%. Your bank gets a cut, the receiving bank gets a cut, and you’re charged hidden exchange rate fees. Your family’s bank won’t even register the transaction until a week later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical cost per transaction for a money sender averages to 7.68%, which come from per-transaction fees associated with payments, like wire fees or hidden exchange rate markups. Facilitating payments is highly profitable for banks, providing them with little incentive to lower fees. Cross-border transactions, from payments to letters of credit generated 40% of global payments transactional revenues during 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/santander-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A excerpt from a leaked internal Santander document shows revenues from international money transfers, and the risk of disruption. Nearly 10% of Santander’s revenue in 2016 came from international transfers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is disrupting this system by offering a higher-security and lower-cost way to send peer-to-peer (P2P) payments — one that requires no intermediary. Because cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are built around a public, decentralized ledger that anyone can use to send and receive money, it cuts down on the need for trusted third parties to verify transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing so, blockchain technology is giving people around the world access to fast, cheap, and borderless payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin transactions can take 30 minutes or up to 16 hours — in extreme cases — to settle. That’s still not perfect, but it represents a leg up from the average 3-day processing time for bank transfers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/screenshot-2018-01-19-13.16.51-1024x682.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The number of confirmed Bitcoin transactions per day has grown 8x from just over 50,000 in the summer of 2014 to more than 400,000 as of 2018.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, as transaction fees can be high, developers are actively working on scaling cheaper solutions for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Other cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin Cash, already have low-priced transactions. Currently, transaction fees on Bitcoin Cash are hovering at around 20 cents per transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One company, TenX, is approaching the payments problem slightly differently. It has built a wallet that’s attached to a debit card, making it easy to spend cryptocurrency everywhere you normally use plastic. The company is building a distributed network to trade between different cryptocurrencies and working to integrate that network with physical cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While cryptocurrencies are a long way from completely replacing fiat when it comes to payments, the last couple of years have seen exponential growth in transaction volume for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin transaction volume grew by 118% in 2016 alone, although much of this was a function of speculative trading (and not P2P payments).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In developing countries today, blockchain promises to give billions of people around the world access to financial services. One example of this is BitPesa, a blockchain company focused on facilitating B2B payments in countries like Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda. BitPesa handles monthly trade volumes of $10M. Compared to a whopping 9.2% fee charged on the average cross-border payment to Kenya, BitPesa is able to slash fees to 3% through the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/atlas_s1br2ehse@2x.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over the past couple of years, BitPay, a payment processor for Bitcoin, has seen a sharp rise in transaction payment volume.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is BitPay, a Bitcoin payment service provider that helps merchants accept and store Bitcoin payments. BitPay has grown its payments volume 328% in the past year, with merchants receiving north of $110M per month. Compared to the 2%-3% fee associated with credit card transactions, BitPay charges 1% per transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One big reason behind the coming disruption of the payments industry is the fact that the creaky infrastructure supporting it is just as liable to disruption — the world of clearance and settlements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-clearance-and-settlements-systems&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Clearance and Settlements Systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that an average bank transfer — as described above — takes three days to settle has a lot to do with the way our financial infrastructure was built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just a pain for the consumer. Moving money around the world is a logistical nightmare for the banks themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, a simple bank transfer — from one account to another — has to bypass a complicated system of intermediaries, from correspondent banks to custodial services, before it ever reaches any kind of destination. The two bank balances have to be reconciled across a global financial system, comprised of a wide network of traders, funds, asset managers and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to send money from a UnicaCredit Banca account in Italy to a Wells Fargo account in the US, the transfer will be executed through the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Communication (SWIFT), which send 24 million messages a day for 10,000 financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/main-qimg-2537e5be23c111ed0e0d2cb976fac14e-c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because UnicaCredit Banka and Wells Fargo don’t have an established financial relationship, they have to search the SWIFT network for a correspondent bank that has a relationship with both banks and can settle the transaction — for a fee. Each correspondent bank maintains different ledgers, at the originating bank and the receiving bank, which means that these different ledgers have to be reconciled at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centralized SWIFT protocol doesn’t actually send the funds, it simply sends the payment orders. The actual money is then processed through a system of intermediaries. Each intermediary adds additional cost to the transaction, and creates a potential point of failure — 60% of B2B payments require manual intervention, each taking between 15-20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/c87cd72ae74b4a91b1c730ff99ae4113.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blockchain, which serves as a decentralized “ledger” of transactions, can completely disrupt this state of play. Rather than using SWIFT to reconcile each financial institution’s ledger, an interbank blockchain could keep track of all transactions publicly and transparently. That means that instead of having to rely on a network of custodial services and correspondent banks, transactions could be settled directly on the blockchain. That would help alleviate the high costs of maintaining a global network of correspondent banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks have estimated that blockchain innovation could cut at least $20B worth of costs from the financial sector by providing better infrastructure for clearance and settlements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ripple, an enterprise blockchain services provider, is the most prominent player attempting to replace SWIFT. While the company is best known for its associated cryptocurrency, XRP, this is separate from Ripple’s banking products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SWIFT messages are one-way, much like emails, which mean that transactions can’t be settled until each party has screened the transaction. By integrating directly with a bank’s existing ledgers, Ripple’s xCurrent product provides banks with a faster, two-way communication protocol that permits real-time messaging and settlement. Ripple currently has over 100 customers signed up to experiment with its blockchain network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/screenshot-2018-01-18-18.07.56-768x516.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: Ripple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R3 is another major enterprise blockchain player catering to banks, and wants to be the “new operating system for financial markets.” It raised $107M from a consortium of banks like Bank of America Merrill Lynch and HSBC. It’s also lost some key members, such as Goldman Sachs, which departed because it wanted more operational control over R3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While projects like Ripple and R3 threaten to disrupt players within the broader financial services ecosystem — like SWIFT or custodian banks — they’re also working with traditional banks to bring greater efficiency to the sector. Ripple and R3 seek to decentralize systems on a smaller scale than public blockchains by connecting financial institutions to the same ledger in order to increase efficiency of transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain projects are doing more than just making existing processes more efficient, however. They’re creating entirely new types of financial activity. The fundraising space is perhaps the best example of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-fundraising&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Fundraising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raising money through venture capital is an arduous process. Entrepreneurs put together decks, sit through countless meetings with partners, and endure long negotiations over equity and valuation in the hopes of exchanging some chunk of their company for a check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the blockchain, you don’t need a platform to raise money. You don’t need venture capitalists. You don’t have negotiations. Anyone is free to raise money from anyone at any time, and anyone can invest in projects they find interesting. In the parlance of Naval Ravikant, it is “open, distributed, and liquid all the way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the blockchain, fundraising takes the form of an initial coin offering (ICO). It’s the blockchain version of an IPO. Projects sell tokens, or coins, in exchange for a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The value of the token is — at least in theory — tied to the success of its implementation in the future. Investing in tokens is a way for investors to bet directly on usage and value. Through ICOs, blockchain companies can short-circuit the conventional fundraising process by selling tokens directly to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of 2017, a whopping $5.6B was raised through ICOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/ico-1-768x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popularity of ICOs has exploded in 2017, with the total amount during the first half of 2017 coming to $1.13B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple immediate benefits to ICOs for blockchain companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, ICOs occur globally and online, giving companies access to an exponentially larger pool of investors. You’re no longer limited to high-net-worth individuals, institutions, and others who are able to show the government that they’re credible investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, ICOs give companies immediate access to liquidity. The moment you sell a token, it’s priced on a 24-hour global market. Compare that to ten years for venture-backed startups. As Earn CEO Balaji Srinivasan says, “the ratio between 10 years and 10 minutes to get the option of liquidity is up to a 500,000x speedup in time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re already seeing the impact of ICOs on the fundraising market. In Q3’17, the deal size of ICOs totaled $1.3M — close to the deal size of all tech angel and seed deals that quarter at $1.4M.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2017.10.04-tech-vs.-ico-funding-768x454.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venture capital is taking notice, with VC firms like Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, and Union Square Ventures all directly investing in ICOs, as well as gaining exposure by investing in cryptocurrency hedge funds. David Pakman, a partner at Venrock, says, “There’s no question that crypto will disrupt the business of venture capital. And I hope it does. The democratization of everything is what has excited me about technology from the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the ICO boom is well underway, we’re simultaneously seeing a broader decline in the market for IPOs, from 7,322 in 1996 to 3,671 in 2017. In 2016, total funds raised from US IPOs dropped to a low of $18.5B, compared to $74.4B in 2014. It’s still not table stakes — fees to investment bankers per IPO can range from 3.5% – 7%. With greater access to private capital and alternative fundraising methods such as ICOs, we can expect to see this profitable market for investment banks decline even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/saupload_comm-number-listed-us-companies-continues-drop-05052017-lg-768x411.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of money raised by ICOs in 2017 was already over 6% of the funds raised by IPOs in the US during the same period. Low interest rates and higher regulation have made private funding more attractive to many startups than the public markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the majority of ICOs thus far have been for pre-revenue blockchain projects, we’re seeing more and more technology companies build around a paradigm of decentralization. Telegram, the messaging app, for example recently announced that it’s trying to raise $2B via ICO. Telegram offers a free service with high user growth — but its lack of revenue makes it unlikely to succeed in the public markets. The idea behind the ICO is to sell tokens to users and bootstrap a payment platform on top of the messaging network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, as blockchain advocates predict, the next Facebook, Google, and Amazon are built around decentralized protocols and launched via ICO, it will eat directly into investment banking margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several promising blockchain companies have emerged around this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies like CoinList, which began as a collaboration between Protocol Labs and AngelList, are helping bring digital assets to the mainstream by helping blockchain companies structure legal and compliant ICOs. CoinList has helped blockchain companies raise over $850M via ICOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/filecoin-on-coinlist-paused-august-11-2017-600x327.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demand for Filecoin’s ICO on CoinList was so high that it caused server overload within an hour of launch. Filecoin ultimately raised over $250M via ICO.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has developed a bank-grade compliance process that blockchain companies can access through a streamlined API, helping projects ensure everything from due diligence to investor accreditation. While CoinList’s platform is designed for blockchain projects, its focus on reducing the logistical and regulatory load around fundraising is being mirrored in the public markets. Investment banks today are experimenting with automation to help eliminate the thousands of work hours that go into an IPO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And CoinList is just the start. A number of companies are emerging around the new ICO ecosystem, from Waves, a platform for storing, managing, and issuing digital assets, to Republic.co’s crypto initiative, which is aimed at helping people invest in ICOs for as little as $10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the majority of ICOs thus far have been for pre-revenue blockchain projects, they have the potential to expand much further and become a viable alternative to traditional funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re still in the early stages of the blockchain, and likely in a bubble. There’s no doubt that many of these projects will fail altogether. What’s interesting is that they’re testing out uses for the blockchain that replace functions of traditional banks. That’s not just limited to company fundraising, but also to the underlying fabric of securities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-securities&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Securities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To buy or sell assets like stocks, debt, and commodities, you need a way to keep track of who owns what. Financial markets today accomplish this through a complex chain of brokers, exchanges, central security depositories, clearing houses, and custodian banks. These different parties have been built around an outdated system of paper ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you want to buy a share of Apple stock. You might place an order through a stock exchange, which matches you with a seller. In the old days, that meant you’d spend cash in exchange for a certificate of ownership for the share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This grows a lot more complicated when we’re trying to execute this transaction electronically. We don’t want to deal with the day-to-day management of the assets — like exchanging certificates, bookkeeping, or managing dividends. So we outsource the shares to custodian banks for safekeeping. Because buyers and sellers don’t always rely on the same custodian banks, the custodians themselves need to rely on a trusted third party to hold onto all the paper certificates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/screenshot-2018-01-31-17.32.39-768x235.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To settle and clear an order on an exchange involves multiple intermediaries and points of failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, that means that when you buy or sell an asset, that order is relayed through a whole bunch of third parties. Transferring ownership is complicated because each party maintains their own version of the truth in a separate ledger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is this system inefficient, but it’s also imprecise. Security transactions take between 1 to 3 days to settle because everyone’s books have to be updated and reconciled at the end of the day. Because there are so many different parties involved, transactions often have to be manually validated. Each party charges a fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain technology promises to revolutionize financial markets by creating a decentralized database of unique, digital assets. With a distributed ledger, it’s possible to transfer the rights to an asset through cryptographic tokens. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have accomplished this with purely digital assets, new blockchain companies are working on ways to tokenize real-world assets, from stocks to real estate to gold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blockchain_31.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential for disruption is massive. The four largest custody banks in the US — State Street, BNY Mellon, Citi, and JP Morgan — each oversees over $15+ trillion worth of assets under custody. While fees are typically lower than .02%, profits come from the sheer volume of assets. Using the blockchain, tokenized securities have the potential to cut out middlemen such as custodian banks altogether, lowering asset exchange fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/custody-banking-and-emerging-kyc-needs-10-638.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The four largest custodian banks in the US each manage $15+ trillion in assets under custody. Source: Trefis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, through smart contracts, tokenized securities can work as programmable equity — paying out dividends or performing stock buybacks through a couple lines of code. Finally, putting real-world assets on the blockchain has the potential to usher in broader, global access to markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polymath is one of the blockchain companies that wants to help migrate trillions of dollars of financial securities to the blockchain. Polymath is building a marketplace and platform that helps people issue security tokens, and implement governance mechanisms to help these new tokens meet regulations. So far, Polymath has announced partnerships with SPiCE VC, Corl, and Ethereum Capital to launch security tokens on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/screenshot-2018-02-01-18.48.45-768x435.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The slide above from Polymath predicts that the market for security tokens will grow to $10 trillion by 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, financial institutions themselves aren’t sitting still. The Australian Stock Exchange announced an effort to replace its system for bookkeeping, clearance, and settlements with a blockchain solution developed by Digital Asset Holdings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last June, Chain, an enterprise-focused blockchain company successfully orchestrated live transactions between the Nasdaq and Citi’s banking infrastructure via integration. Meanwhile, Overstock’s CEO is launching a trading platform called tZero, which wants to create a blockchain-backed dark pool, or private exchange, for securities that might be listed on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While tokenized assets are a hugely promising use case for the blockchain, the biggest hurdle is regulatory. It’s still unclear if ownership on the blockchain is legally binding, while tokens remain an ambiguous term that don’t currently have legal standing. Regulatory and legislative guidance will be key to the success of these nascent projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worlds of the consumer, the financial institution, and blockchain are slowly converging. Another space where that convergence has the potential to completely upend the way finance operates today is lending and credit — a domain that’s no stranger to disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-loans-and-credit&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Loans and Credit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional banks and lenders underwrite loans based on an inaccurate and insecure system of credit reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you fill out an application for a bank loan, the bank has to evaluate the risk that you won’t pay them back. They do this by looking at factors like your credit score, debt-to-income ratio, and home ownership status. To get this information, they have to access your credit report provided by one of three major credit agencies: Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. Based on that information, banks price the risk of a default into the fees and interest collected on loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/https_2f2fblogs-images.forbes.com2fgreatspeculations2ffiles2f20172f122fcb_qa_loanportfoliosplit_17q3-e1513710088185-768x270.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The five biggest US banks control $3.7 trillion worth of commercial lending.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This centralized system is often hostile to consumers. The Federal Trade Commission estimates that one in five Americans have a “potentially material error” in their credit score that negatively impacts their ability to get a loan. Further, concentrating this sensitive information within three institutions creates a lot of vulnerability. Last year’s Equifax hack exposed the credit information of 143M Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternative lending on the blockchain offers a cheaper, more efficient, and more secure way of making personal loans to a broader pool of consumers. With a cryptographically secure, decentralized registry of historical payments, consumers could apply for loans based on a global credit score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While blockchain projects in the lending space are still in their infancy, there are a couple of interesting projects out there around P2P loans, credit, and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/screenshot-2018-02-02-16.48.52.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bloom protocol seeks to issue credit based on a track record of successful identity attestation on the network, without trusted third parties.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One project, SALT, is a lending platform for blockchain-backed loans that raised $48M via ICO. You buy a SALT token to become a member of the network, and then put up some cryptocurrency holdings as collateral. That allows you to borrow money from lenders on the platform. Pay your loan back on time, and you get your crypto back. SALT’s not starting off taking on the lending industry as a whole. Its wedge is helping people with crypto-assets get short-term cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another project, EthLend, recently raised $16.2M via ICO. EthLend wants to build a decentralized peer-to-peer lending application on top of Ethereum. This is how it works: when a borrower issues a loan request, a smart contract is created with the loan amount, interest rate, and time frame. The borrower puts up tokens of EthLend as collateral. If the loan isn’t paid in time, the lender receives tokens as collateral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celsius, another P2P blockchain company, takes less of a free-market approach. Co-founder Alex Mashinsky says: “We offer members the chance to get paid high interest when they have a positive balance in the wallet and give them access to a credit line with low interest when they run out of cash at the end of the month.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/screenshot-2018-01-18-15.40.26-768x425.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a blockchain-powered loan industry requires more than just platforms — it takes the development of standards and infrastructure. Development is well on its way. Dharma, for example, is a protocol for tokenized debt. It aims to provide developers with the tools and standards necessary for building online debt marketplaces. Meanwhile, Bloom wants to bring credit scoring to the blockchain, and is building a protocol for managing identity, risk, and credit scoring on the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most of these projects focus on creating liquidity through loans around people’s existing crypto assets, they’re also jumpstarting the infrastructure that will enable bigger disruption in loans via blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond the hype&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disruption doesn’t happen overnight. Blockchain technology is still in its infancy, and a lot of the actual technology has yet to be perfected. Die-hard believers in cryptocurrency believe that it will replace banks altogether. Others think that blockchain technology will supplement traditional financial infrastructure, making it more efficient. One thing is clear, however: blockchain will indeed transform the banking industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sriram Jothiswaran</name></author><category term="blockchain" /><summary type="html">Blockchain is transforming everything from payments transactions to how money is raised in the private market.

&lt;p&gt;On the company’s earnings call on Tuesday, CEO Hikmet Ersek told analysts that the company is experimenting with Ripple for settling transactions and for capital optimization. Western Union is also testing Ripple’s native currency, XRP, a spokesperson confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ersek’s comments, cited below, come a month after Ripple announced a tie-up with Western Union’s rival Moneygram, which is also testing XRP in money transfers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western Union’s use of XRP is a major boost for Ripple as skeptics claim it is superfluous to the money transfer process and banks don’t actually need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many banks are using Ripple’s blockchain software (known as XCurrent) to keep track of their transfers, only a handful are also using a product (known as XRapid) that integrates XRP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adoption by banks of XRP is critical to the growth of Ripple—which has described it as a “strategic weapon“—and to the value of the currency, which currently has a market cap of about $42 billion, and has swung wildly since it shot up to nearly $4 in early January (it is now worth around $1.07).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Western Union CEO’s remarks about Ripple came in response to a question about the applications of cryptocurrency in money transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I mean is it a technology looking for a business or do you see real use cases here?” asked Susquehanna analyst James Freeman during the earnings call.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sriram Jothiswaran</name></author><category term="cryptocurrency" /><summary type="html">You can add Western Union to the growing list of banks and financial institutions that are test-driving Ripple, the blockchain company trying to become the go-to service for global money transfers.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Understand Blockchain - Beginner to Advanced - Part 2</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/understand-blockchain-beginner-to-advanced-part-2" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Understand Blockchain - Beginner to Advanced - Part 2" /><published>2018-02-11T22:11:31+05:30</published><updated>2018-02-11T22:11:31+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/understand-blockchain-beginner-to-advanced-part-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/understand-blockchain-beginner-to-advanced-part-2">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;/understand-blockchain-beginner-to-advanced&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; of this series you would have got some idea about distributed ledger technology  and architecture of blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With advent of bitcoin blockchain there came the need to make use of blockchain technology in different fields by limiting certain user groups with access to confidential data. New technologies are out faster than before, whatever the technology may do the end user’s main concern is safety &amp;amp; security. Here comes the need for permission in blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private institutions like banks realized that they could use the core idea of blockchain as a distributed ledger technology (DLT), and create a permissioned blockchain (private or federated), where the validator is a member of a consortium or separate legal entities of the same organization. The term blockchain in the context of permissioned private ledger is highly controversial and disputed. This is why the term distributed ledger technologies emerged as a more general term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will get into permissioned blockchain later on our hyperledger series &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;(coming soon)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For India users, a way to transfer money digitally is especially useful for local merchants and for friends and family to transfer funds among themselves. WhatsApp has reportedly signed up a number of Indian banks to help bolster its payments service. The company also makes use of the Indian government’s Unified Payments Interface, or UPI, framework, which allows for instant transfer between participating banks. It’s not clear when the full payments service will launch in India, or if it will make its way to Europe or North America any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sriram Jothiswaran</name></author><category term="whatsapp" /><summary type="html">Whatsapp has been working on peer to peer payments for a long peroid of time.
