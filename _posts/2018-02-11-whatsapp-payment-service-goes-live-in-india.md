Whatsapp has been working on peer to peer payments for a long peroid of time. As a WhatsApp beta tester i tweeted regarding this major update last year multiple times and got fed up on not coming up for general use. Finally Facebook owned messaging company launched payment service in beta in India. Many beta users saw this feature poping up in both IOS and Android.



For India users, a way to transfer money digitally is especially useful for local merchants and for friends and family to transfer funds among themselves. WhatsApp has reportedly signed up a number of Indian banks to help bolster its payments service. The company also makes use of the Indian government’s Unified Payments Interface, or UPI, framework, which allows for instant transfer between participating banks. It’s not clear when the full payments service will launch in India, or if it will make its way to Europe or North America any time soon.
