# Introduction

This article introduces you to the distributed ledger technologies (DLT), this includes blockchain too.

What you will learn :-

* Blockchain and DLT
* Permissioned and Permissionless Blockchains
* Consensus algorithms and Smart Contracts



## Growth of Distributed Ledger Technologies

Let's get back to late nineties were computers filled the entire room. Mainframes were more centralized in nature that would serve the entire building. The access was through dumb terminals which does I/O operations without  much of storage and processing.

 With the invention of PC's similar computational capabilities were now housed both on the clients, as well as the servers. This gave rise to 'client-server' architecture, which supported the development of relational database systems. Massive data sets, which are housed on mainframes, could move onto a distributed architecture. This data could replicate from server to server, and subsets of the data could be accessed and processed on clients, and then, synced back to the server.

As time went by, Internet and cloud architecture enabled global access using various devices.There are two major problems with cloud computing: 

(a) users donâ€™t own their own data, and 

(b) remote servers are security holes. 

With a move away from cloud computing, decentralized systems like Bitcoin give explicit control of digital assets to end-users and remove the need to trust any third-party servers and infrastructure.
