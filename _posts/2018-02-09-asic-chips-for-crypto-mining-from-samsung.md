Samsung has started manufacturing ASIC chips for cryptocurrency mining, a company spokesperson recently confirmed this news.

Korean media claimed that Samsung has started this move in collaboration with a Chinese distribution partner. Samsung already manufactures high capacity GPU to handle computer graphics, some which are already used for mining purposes.

The ASIC place is currently dominated by China-based  Bitmain and Canaan Creative, Samsung is all set to give a tough competition.



How Samsung fits into this equation isn’t clear right now. At a base level, it will rival TSMC — which it knows well from competing in other industry segments — for the attention of companies that build and sell finished mining products in the market. But, if Samsung’s move brings on new partners or if it makes hardware itself, then it could enable competitors to Bitmain and co.
